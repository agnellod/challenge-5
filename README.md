# challenge-5
- First I copied the starter code
- Then I changed the html file to better target all the times in one class
- After that I started adding java script so that the page would run 
- I added dayjs so that the current date and time would be displayed at the top of the screen
- Then I added a few global variables and started making functions
- I made a for loop to add colors to time slots depending on what time of the day it is
- After that a made a part to save info to local storage after click happens
- Then I called all the values from storage based on the hour it is
